# Whatsup — Data Structure Chat Application (C++)

Whatsup is a **Data Structure Application** built in C++ that simulates a simple chat system in the console.  
It demonstrates the use of **Stacks** and **Linked Lists** to manage contacts and chat history just like messaging apps do internally.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This application was developed to apply and practice core Data Structure concepts through a real-world scenario:

- **Stack** → Manages contacts with recent interaction on the top
